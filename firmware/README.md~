Here are Autodesk Inventor 2015 CAD files and the resultant STL files.
There are two top-level Inventor assembly (`.iam') files for the top
and bottom of the dome. The bottom-level part files are in the three
subdirectories.

The .STL files were created for the Objet printers at Pier 9 which
can print in two kinds of resin: transparent and opaque. So each half
of the sphere has two .stl files corresponding to the clear and opaque
parts. The bottom half is identical to the top half save for the
bottom triangular segment has a 1" diameter hole for the pedestal and
three small ventilation holes.
